# Future Roadmap: SeaTrace AI Vision

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for transforming SeaTrace into a complete, AI-driven marine intelligence platform.

## 1. AI Simulation & Predictive Modeling
- **AI "What-If" Simulation Mode**: 
    - **Goal**: Analyze how oil spills evolve under different wind, weather, ocean current, and response conditions.
    - **Tech**: Monte Carlo simulations integrated with real-time fluid dynamics models.
- **Training & Simulation Mode**: 
    - **Goal**: Synthetic spill scenarios for emergency response practice.
    - **Tech**: Augmented Reality (AR) overlays on the dashboard for "War Room" exercises.

## 2. Advanced Intelligence & Profiling
- **AI Investigator Mode**:
    - **Goal**: Automatically build spill timelines by correlating satellite imagery, vessel tracks, and environmental timestamps.
    - **Tech**: Temporal Knowledge Graphs to link disparate events into a coherent narrative.
- **Repeat-Offender Vessel Tracker**:
    - **Goal**: Profile ships based on historical suspicious behavior (e.g., frequent AIS disabling, loitering in high-risk zones).
    - **Tech**: Anomaly detection on long-term vessel trajectory databases.

## 3. Impact Assessment & Economics
- **Economic Loss Estimator**:
    - **Goal**: Predict cleanup costs and economic impacts on local fishing and tourism industries.
    - **Tech**: Econometric models trained on historical spill cost data.
- **Spill Severity Classification**:
    - **Goal**: AI-driven categorization of spills (Tier 1/2/3) to automate resource allocation.
    - **Tech**: Computer Vision classification of spill thickness and extent.

## 4. Legal & Compliance
- **Legal-Evidence Mode**:
    - **Goal**: Securely store time-stamped satellite data and AI inference logs for investigations in court.
    - **Tech**: Blockchain immutability (hashing data to a ledger) to ensure chain-of-custody.
- **Smart Geo-Fencing**:
    - **Goal**: Proactive alerts when spills or suspect vessels approach sensitive zones (Marine Sanctuaries, Desalination Plants).

## 5. User Engagement & Transparency
- **Interactive "Ask SeaTrace" Interface**:
    - **Goal**: Natural-language query interface (e.g., "Show me the predicted impact on the Mumbai coast in 24 hours").
    - **Tech**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) LLM pipeline connected to geospatial databases.
- **Crowd-Assisted Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Allow verified coastal observers to upload geotagged photos to refine satellite detections.
- **Public Transparency Dashboard**:
    - **Goal**: A sanitized, public-facing view to build trust and community awareness.

## 6. Operational Excellence
- **Recovery Progress Tracking**: 
    - **Goal**: Monitor the effectiveness of cleanup operations over time using differencing imagery.
- **AI Model Health Monitoring**:
    - **Goal**: Real-time dashboards for model accuracy, drift detection, and latency.
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**:
    - **Goal**: Allow third-party datasets (e.g., drone feeds, buoy sensors) to be easily ingested.
